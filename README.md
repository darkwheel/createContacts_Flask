# createContactsWithGoogle

This reason I created this repository was that I wanted to easily create a contact in my iPhone with the information 
provided by a Google search. Every information is already in that contact card of google maps, but to copy paste every information is
annoying.

So to use my repository you have to clone the repo and start up app.py (Flask) 
After startup you should see two forms and one button to send the information and execute the programm.

First type in your API Key for the Google Places API (I am not providing mine :) )
And then type in your search query you want to use to search the company and create the vCard file

You can use everything also on **https://contactcreator.herokuapp.com/** (BETA)

If there are any bugs, please let me now and i will try to help you!
